<div id="Interest" class="tabcontent">
  <p>My interest in IT started at a young age, it would have been around <br>
      10/11 years old. I started playing The Sim, begging my parents for <br>
      every expansion, and then spending hours on the computer just playing.<br>
      This progressed deeper into gaming as I got older and resulted in <br>
      enough technical ability to build and troubleshoot my own gaming devices.</p> 

   <p>After I had my first child, I was trying to get back into the work <br>
       force and a job in IT came up at a local university and my passion <br>
       has only grown from there. I love the rush of fixing or creating <br>
       something, working out something no one else can figure out how to do.</p> 

   <p>From my start in IT Support on a Service Desk I moved through several<br>
       different AV and IT roles. Ultimately, I wound up support the online <br>
       learning management system as well as the lecture capture system for <br>
       a major university in NSW. From there I moved into a projects team <br>
       where I worked with a team to implement the lecture capture system from<br>
       the company I now work for.</p>

<div id="RMIT" class="tabcontent">
  <p>I chose RMIT for 2 reasons. It is a technology university and I want a<br>
    technology degree. What better place to get a technology degree than a <br>
    well-respected technology university? The rest of my choice was driven <br>
    purely by requirement. Due my career and family commitments I absolutely <br>
    require the ability to study online with a workload that suits me.</p> 
</div>

<div id="Expectations" class="tabcontent">
  <p>I would like to solidify and build on my current IT knowledge, fill the<br>
    gap where others have education and I only have work experience and <br>
    experience the ‘uni’ experience I didn’t have when I was younger. </p>
