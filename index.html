    <p style="color:pink;font-family:candara;text-align:center;">Born in Nepean Hospital, Penrith, I spent most of my <br>
        life living within a 15km radius of that hospital. I am married and <br>
        have 4 wonderful children. Cooper (13), Lucas (10), Jackson 8 and <br>
        Eliana 7. I currently work as Support and Solutions Engineer for an<br>
        American media company. </p>
            
    <p style="color:pink;font-family:candara;text-align:center;">I am Australian. I can speak English and only English.<br>
        I wish I had the time to pick up a second language. I play indoor <br>
        soccer, I own an Eclectus parrot named Luna and an Albino Darwin <br>
        Carpet Python naked Ekans. I am also strangely into audiobooks at <br>
        the moment.</p>

<div id="Interests" class="tabcontent">
  <p>My interest in IT started at a young age, it would have been around <br>
      10/11 years old. I started playing The Sim, begging my parents for <br>
      every expansion, and then spending hours on the computer just playing.<br>
      This progressed deeper into gaming as I got older and resulted in <br>
      enough technical ability to build and troubleshoot my own gaming devices.</p> 

   <p>After I had my first child, I was trying to get back into the work <br>
       force and a job in IT came up at a local university and my passion <br>
       has only grown from there. I love the rush of fixing or creating <br>
       something, working out something no one else can figure out how to do.</p> 

   <p>From my start in IT Support on a Service Desk I moved through several<br>
       different AV and IT roles. Ultimately, I wound up support the online <br>
       learning management system as well as the lecture capture system for <br>
       a major university in NSW. From there I moved into a projects team <br>
       where I worked with a team to implement the lecture capture system from<br>
       the company I now work for.</p>
