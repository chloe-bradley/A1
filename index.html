    <p style="color:pink;font-family:candara;text-align:center;font-size:3vw;">I was born in Nepean Hospital, Penrith. I spent most of my 
        life living within a 15km radius of that hospital. I am married and 
        have 4 wonderful children. Cooper (13), Lucas (10), Jackson 8 and 
        Eliana 7. I currently work as Support and Solutions Engineer for an
        American media company. </p>
            
    <p style="color:pink;font-family:candara;text-align:center;font-size:3vw;">I am Australian. I can speak English and only English.
        I wish I had the time to pick up a second language. I play indoor 
        soccer, I own an Eclectus parrot named Luna and an Albino Darwin 
        Carpet Python naked Ekans. I am also strangely into audiobooks at 
        the moment.</p>
